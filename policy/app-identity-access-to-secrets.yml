    description: This policy connects authn identities to an application identity. It defines a layer named for an application that contains the whitelisted identities that can authenticate to the authn-k8s endpoint. Any permissions granted to the application layer will be inherited by the whitelisted authn identities, thereby granting access to the authenticated identity.
